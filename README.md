Welcome to my Tableau Projects repository, a curated collection of interactive dashboards showcasing my skills in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling. Each project demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into clear, actionable insights using Tableau’s powerful analytical capabilities.

This repository is organized into individual folders, with each project containing:

- A packaged Tableau workbook (.twbx)

- Supporting datasets (where permitted)

- A project-specific README outlining objectives, methodology, and key insights

- Screenshots or previews of the final dashboard

My work spans multiple domains, including business performance, customer analytics, HR metrics, and operational insights. The goal of this portfolio is to highlight not only technical proficiency, but also my approach to designing intuitive, insight‑driven dashboards that support decision‑making.
